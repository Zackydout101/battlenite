## Description of the Project

This project was made with Unity using C#. The goal of this project was to use multiple plugins including Photon. The idea was to recreate the popular Fortnite but in 2D and on mobile. This was my first project to understand how to use Unity. This project contains a bunch of avatars which were used to make animations and a whole world to move the characters. A lot of physics and algoritm were needed to construct the logic of the game.

## Google API (In app purchasing)

We tried to use google ads mobile  ads to incorporate ads to gain revenue from the game and use a certain algorithm to show ads based on how long the player would play the game. In app purchases were incorporated to test out the api. We also added an in app purchase for users to buy more diamonds in the game with real money. 

## Gameplay 1 vs 1 Player

This game was built to incorporate local multiplayer. We tried making a joystick to make the fun follow the joystick but I decided to delete that part because playing with joy on a phone was too small. So I wanted to add simplicity. The goal of the game is to reach the tower using your abilities by placing a wall nad a ramp. If you run out of ammo you will need to go get some ammo or get some med kits. The first one to reach the highest tower wins. Watch out for the fall damage, if you die you have to start from the beinning. Good luck!

## Design the Maps

A lot of fun was to create the maps and understand the physics with the characters.

## Multiplayer

Multiplayer has been integrated which would use a free server to send the data over. Multiplayer has been challenging because the larger you have maps the laggier it is. I decided to remove the pistol feature because it would lag too much so multiply is just a park cour.

A lot of stuff needs to be added and fixing bugs. But just understanding how data structures works and building the algorithm for the characters and adding different abilities.
